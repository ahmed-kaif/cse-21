# Problem 1 
- User Input: a, b 
- a -> prime factor
- b -> prime factor
- find gcd(a,b)
- you can use map

- output:
    Prime factors of a, b & GCD(a,b)
## Part 2:
Eucledian algorithm to find gcd of a,b 

# Problem 2: 
Take a number n from user. 
Use sieve algorithm to find all the primes less than or equal to n.

## part 2: 
Take a number n find whether it is mersene prime or not? [ 2^p - 1 ] 

p = log2(p+1)
if(p is prime) print yes
else print no
